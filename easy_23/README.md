Challenge #23 [easy]
-------------------

Given a list, return the first half of the list as one list and the second half of the list as a second list. For instance, given the input list {1 2 3 4}, output the two lists {1 2} and {3 4}. If the input list has an odd number of items, the middle item can go to either list, so that the input list {1 2 3 4 5} can result in the output lists {1 2} and {3 4 5} or the output lists {1 2 3} and {4 5}.
Your task is to write the function that splits a list in two halves.

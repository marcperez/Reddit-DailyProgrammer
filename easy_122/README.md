Challenge #122 [easy]
-------------------

As a crude form of hashing function, Lars wants to sum the digits of a number. Then he wants to sum the digits of the result, and repeat until he have only one digit left. He learnt that this is called the digital root of a number, but the Wikipedia article is just confusing him.
Can you help him implement this problem in your favourite programming language?
